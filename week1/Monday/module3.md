### The khan academy has some great informational material
They have an [introduction to the internet](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/internet-intro) course


They also have a few [introduction to web design, HTML + CSS](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming)
I would start with the introduction to js drawing & animation 

If you have yet to use the [code academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/all), check out their courses

If you are interested in entering a code school or coding bootcamp, Hack Reactor has created an [online resource to prepare](http://www.hackreactor.com/prep-programs/), and I would
highly suggest going through this track.
