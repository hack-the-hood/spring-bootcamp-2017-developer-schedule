Talking Points
In today’s job market and entrepreneurial landscape, there is no room for being another face in the crowd. You have to separate yourself from the competition. You have to be more appealing to your target audience and you can achieve it by creating a recognizable personal brand.

Importance of Creating Your Brand
You can influence the thinking that happens about you
In the 21st century the online you is just as important as the real you 
You take control of it otherwise others will
Be authentic! How many personalities can you think of who represent themselves honestly, and despite their flaws and issues are still beloved? Alternatively, when people project false qualities the deception doesn’t last long and they are despised once their true characteristics are known.

Creating a vision for your future and implementing that vision can lead to:
A better career
Better contacts and clients
Industry recognition

Strengthsfinder Activity (35-45min)
Show the “Do what you love and you’ll never work a day in your life” slide. Ask students to explain if they agree with it. Why/Why not?
Show the “Life isn’t about finding yourself” slide. Ask students if they agree with it.
Explain to students that at Hack the Hood we believe that everyone should do what they love and what comes naturally and we define this as a strength.
Explain to students that they are going to take a very powerful assessment that will help them identify what their strengths are. Remind them that these are the natural gifts and talents they were already born with, not what they have to go to school for.  Now their “job” is to recognize them, refine them and share them with the world.
Have each student complete the the Strengthsfinder Assessment here. Allow students to take 15 minutes to complete the assessment. If there are words or language that youth do not understand, please offer to help explain. 
Afterwards, have each student print out findings. Remind students that there are no right or wrong answers and ask students if they have any questions prior to starting the assignment.
After students save their findings, allow everyone to process and absorb the results. Some students may agree and/or disagree with the findings. Allow the students to come to their own conclusions based on their results.
Ask students to pair up for a debrief that focuses on the questions below. Allow each person 1-2 minutes to share and then switch out to the other partner so that everyone has equal amounts of time to share.
