Warm Up Exercise
Play Key & Peele Obama Meet and Greet video (2 minutes). Ask students a few questions to generate discussion:
When and why did “Obama” change the way he greeted people in the crowd?
Who held the most power in this situation and why?
How do you greet your family, friends, co-workers, and students differently?

Alternatively, play the SNL Enchilada skit (5 minutes). Ask students a few questions to generate discussion:
Why are the White people in the skit speaking with an exaggerated Spanish accent?
Why does their way of speaking make “Antonio Mendoza”, the Latino man, uncomfortable? What other ways could he have responded?
Who held the most power in this situation and why?

Talking points
Introduce the module vocabulary. Code-switching is a natural, common practice that we use to make sure we’re being understood and respected. When we change the words we use, the way we pronounce certain words, change the type of clothes we wear, or body language we use depending on the environment we are code-switching.

Explain the importance of being able to code-switch to standard English and professional American dress standards in work and educational settings. Though there is a common linguistic and cultural American standard everyone is expected to perform, there is nothing inferior about anyone’s language or cultural expression. In fact, in many cases the dialects we use are more succinct than standard English. One example is the word “Ima” which is a combination of the words “I am going to”. “Ima” shortens a four word phrase to three letter word. This word shows that sometimes culturally , when understood by speaker and listener, is preferable to the standard phrase.

In 1996 the Oakland, CA school board passed a resolution to define Ebonics as a native language of 28,000 African American children in the school district. This move ignited national debate about whether or not Ebonics was a dialect of English, a separate language, and what it meant for the students whose first learned way of speaking was Ebonics.

Code-switching is not something that only people of color do, but it is widespread in communities of color because the US has a tradition of shutting people of color out of opportunities based on how they speak and dress. During World War II, amid rations on the production of wool clothing and racial tensions in California, White servicemen began attacking Latino and Filipino youth who wore zoot suits (long, baggy, tailored suits popular in the 1930s–40s). These attacks in 1943 led to the zoot suit riots. The criminalization of style is currently growing in the US. In several states and counties a person can be fined or jailed for wearing sagging pants. In some cases the law applies to pants worn just 3 inches below the waist. Ask students for reflections on these historical and current events.

Translation Activity (15 minutes)
Break students up into four even groups. Task the group with writing a quick anecdote using as much slang and non-standard English as possible. Ask that they refrain from using curse words or vulgar language, but otherwise leave the story content to their discretion. Allow 5 minutes for students to write their story. Once each group is finished ask them to pass their story to the group next to them. When each group has another group’s story task them with translating the story into standard English. Remind them to try to keep the meaning as close to the original. If they don’t understand a word or phrase ask them to give their best guess. When the translation is complete ask students to report back on the process. The purpose of this activity is to show how effective communication can happen in standard and non-standard English.

Example of a story using slang and non-standard English:
I was looking for some grub in da fridge earlier but there wasn’t nothin there. I was bout to hit up Taco Bell, but they low-key trash. Mickey D’s was open so I pulled up but they beef sus af, so I just got some fries. I could beast on one of dem Whole Foods burritos rn. I think I’m finna get one. Wassup fam, you tryna go half?

Example of a standard English translation:
Earlier today I was hungry, but when I checked my refrigerator it was empty. I thought about going to Taco Bell, but their food isn’t good quality. Mc Donald’s was open so I went there, but their beef is also of a very low quality so I only ate french fries. I’m still hungry and would eagerly eat a Whole Foods burrito right now. I think I’m about to go get a burrito, would you like to share it with me?

Discussing Microaggressions
Despite the definition given, micro-aggressions not limited to race. They can be used based on gender, politics, religion, sexuality, ability, class, citizenship/work status, language, age, education, etc.
Examples of microaggressions:
touching a Black person’s natural hair without asking
saying "the weather is being bipolar lately” to a person with bipolar disorder
telling a Mexican man “You’re so cool, you’re not like other Mexican guys."
seeing a woman carrying heavy objects and asking “Need help, honey?”

It can be difficult to talk about micro-aggressions and identity openly, especially as a minority. Often people who don’t have firsthand knowledge of a similar experience will have a hard time understanding your experience. It can feel overwhelming to be the target of a micro-aggression and the one who has to make others recognize it.

Microaggressions and insults can hurt even more when you are the only member of a particular group present and you don’t feel like there’s anyone you can rely on to support you. Discuss why it is important to be able to recognize micro-aggressions and have healthy ways of responding.

Identity Activity (20 minutes)
Have students write an example of a micro-aggression they personally experienced on a shared large sheet of paper. They can write more than one or a micro-aggression that happened to someone else. Once everyone has written something the instructor should choose a few to discuss with the class. Ask them how they responded at the time and how they would respond now.

Give the students another large sheet of paper and have them write their responses to the following questions as affirmations of their identities.
Who are you?
What are you most proud of?
Who do you hope to become?
Once they finish have the students tear up the sheet that contains the micro-aggressions and throw it away. Then post the paper with positive affirmations on the wall where it can stay for the remainder of the boot camp.

Talking Points (10 minutes)
Talk about how workplace stress can negatively affect mental and physical health. Share self care tips and discuss ways to deal with stress. While we may not always be able to change our environment or how other people treat us, we can always take steps to ensure our personal health and wellness.
There are various health risks that come from stress/depression. 
Exercise produces endorphins, chemicals in the brain that act as natural painkillers, and improve the ability to sleep, which in turn reduces stress.
Fast food consumers are 51% more likely to develop depression than people who consume little to no fast food. 
Sleep deprivation can increase risk of stroke, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and can lead to obesity and memory loss.
Viewing and interacting with nature (soil, trees, animals, etc) can put you in a good mood.
Making art can reduce stress. 45 minutes of creative activity significantly lessens stress in the body, regardless of artistic experience or talent. Even simply looking at art stimulates the dopamine production in our brains, which makes us feel good.
Self Care Tips: Energize, Be Mindful, Seek Help, Connect, and Slow Down. See graphic.
