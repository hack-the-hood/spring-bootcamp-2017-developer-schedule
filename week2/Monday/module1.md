Case Studies
Walmart
Walmart is the world's largest company by revenue, according to the Fortune Global 500 list in 2014, the biggest private employer in the world with over two million employees, and the largest retailer in the world.

People:
The majority of Walmart workers are denied full time employment, make less than $25,000 a year and do not receive health insurance. In the Fall of 2014 over 2,000 Walmart stores signed a petition urging the company to adopt full time work schedules and a minimum hourly rate of $15 per hour.
Planet:
• Walmart makes big claims about greenhouse emissions but Wal Mart's greenhouse gas emissions are growing, not shrinking.
• Its low-cost, low-quality products lead to more waste as they have to be replaced more frequently.
• The Walmart PAC and the Walton Family Foundation fund projects that destroy the planet like the Keystone XL Tar Sands Pipeline.

Profit:
$16 billion in annual profits. Its owners the Waltons are worth $150 billion are the richest family in the United States and make 8.6 million a day from Walmart dividends.
 
Monsanto
Monsanto Company is the  leading producer of genetically engineered GMO’s (genetically modified organisms)
People: GMO’s have been linked to tumors, birth defects, cancer, autism, parkinson's and alzheimer's disease. Over the last 10 years the company has spent over $52 million making sure that GMO foods aren’t labeled in the United States and abroad. In March of 2014 protesters in 436 cities and 52 countries participated in the March on Monsanto to challenge the companies business practices
Planet: Monsanto’s products have been linked to environmental pollution that contributes to dead zones in the ocean and the mass killing of bees
Profit: $58 billion


Apple Inc. is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Cupertino, California, is the world's second-largest information technology company by revenue after Samsung Electronics, and the world's third-largest mobile phone maker. On November 25, 2014, in addition to being the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization, Apple became the first U.S. company to be valued at over $700B.
 
People: For optimal profit margin Apple must produce the iPhones for cheap. Since Apple only uses top quality electronic parts, the difference is made up in cheap labor. The NYT reports that workers at Foxconn, the former manufacturer of the iPhone, make $22 for a twelve hour shift, and are often forced to work even longer hours. There were so many suicides in the on-site dorms where the workers live that Foxconn had to install nets on the sides of the buildings.
 
Planet: The iPhone and other Apple products have the conflict mineral Coltan in them. Coltan is heat resistant, and ideal for transmitting electric charges. This mineral is rare, expensive (a mine can be worth hundreds of millions of US dollars), and prevalent in war torn Congo. Since 1998, 5-7 million people have died in an ongoing civil war being fought, largely, over control of the mines. The mineral can be found in most electronics company’s products, but Apple is the world’s biggest and should start the trend of boycotting conflict minerals.
 
Planet: In 2011 Apple was responsible for putting 23.1 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. And while Apple says they’re working diligently to decrease their carbon footprint, their emissions rose 34% in 2012
Profit: Stock valued at $597 billion as of 2014
