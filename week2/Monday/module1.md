Introduction
Raise your hand if you were ever afraid or insecure when speaking publicly. 
That is a common feeling, but one that you can work to overcome. Even if you aren’t nervous about public speaking it can be hard to create a clear structure to your speech. Public speaking is important because great public speaking can allow your audience to 
Let’s practice and study some ways to get better at this skill. Being able to present your thoughts eloquently will help your education, career, and personal life.

Introduce vocabulary and talk briefly about what we’ll cover in the module.

Warm up Exercise (10 minutes)
This exercise will illustrate that how we speak can be as important as what we’re saying. Ask for a young person to join the instructor to demonstrate the exercise. Introduce yourself with the following prompt while trying to express a distinct emotion. Their partner must introduce themselves while reflecting the emotional expression of their partner. If the first person is angry in their introduction the partner must also be angry. Demonstrate the exercise once and have all students practice with a partner.

Hello [partner name], my name is [youth’s name] and I am a [writer, artist, student, etc.]

Discussion
Filler words like Um, Uh, Well, Like, Basically, Actually, Literally, You know, I mean, and I guess usually don’t express anything and should be used as sparingly as possible. When a speaker uses these words too much they give the impression that they don’t know what they’re talking about or lack confidence.

Play Taylor Mali and Melissa Lozada-Oliva performance videos (6 minutes) and pause the videos at some points for discussion. Why did Taylor write this poem? How is he making his point? Why did Melissa wrote this poem in response to Taylor’s? What did you feel while watching these videos? Are there times when it would be inappropriate to use filler words in your speech? Situations when it would be appropriate? Do you ever feel frustrated that someone is trying to tell you the “correct” way of speaking? How important is it to be authentic, but also understood when speaking?

Guidelines
The primary types of speech are as follows:
Persuasive such as political speeches or advertising.
Informative such as presenting research.
Impromptu such as being called on in class or commenting during a meeting.
Commemorative such as graduation, wedding, and other rites of passage speeches.

Parts of an effective public speech
Explain why you’re speaking if it is not obvious. Introduce yourself and break the ice.
Be prepared. This includes knowing your audience. What do they already know about the subject? What do they need to know? What is the general mood? Use that to make your speech as appropriate as possible. Practice your speech in front of a mirror, on video, or with a friend to figure out what you can improve.
Eye contact. Try to pick a few people in different areas of the room and look in their direction throughout your speech. Don’t stare at the ceiling, floor, your notes, or one individual.
Use anecdotes and evidence to make your point. Research meaningful statistics or stories related to your subject. 
Voice control and body language. Speak loudly enough for everyone in the room to hear you. Don’t use a monotonous tone. Turn nervous energy into movement. Hand gestures will help keep the audience interested and watching.
End with strength. Conclude by summarizing your main point. Avoid trailing off or abruptly ending your speech. Ending a speech with “So, yeah” and similar phrases undermines the previous points you made.

Nervous? Remember to:
Breathe. Take a deep breath before you begin and take pauses to breathe after complete statements.
Bend your knees. The best standing posture is both feet flat on the floor at hip width apart, knees slightly bent, back straight, and shoulders relaxed.
If you need to think, take a pause and do so. Introduce yourself or break the ice some other way in the beginning. While a pause might seem long to you, to the listening audience a few seconds of silence actually helps them focus on you and the content of your speech.

Instructor Notes: Instructor should keep time and stop youth at the one minute mark. After everyone speaks on their topic hold a discussion around the different challenges that youth experienced during the activity. Which public speaking techniques did they use? Was it hard for anyone to speak for a full minute? To avoid using filler words? Did many students go beyond the time limit?
